# BayesPrism

This repository provides a tool for generating bayesprism objects, enabling downstream analysis of bulk RNA-seq data, specifically focusing on cell proportion estimation. This functionality is particularly useful for validating cell signatures derived from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, as demonstrated in Sivakumar et al., 2025 (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-55424-2) to validate signatures of adaptive-enriched versus myeloid-enriched PDAC scRNA-seq data.

## Overview
This allows users to:
* **Prepare Bulk RNA-seq Data:** Format bulk RNA-seq data (e.g., TCGA_PAAD) for cell proportion estimation.
* **Validate scRNA-seq Signatures:** Assess the enrichment of cell signatures derived from scRNA-seq data within bulk RNA-seq samples.
* **Estimate Cell Proportions:** Facilitate the estimation of cell type proportions within bulk RNA-seq samples using appropriate deconvolution algorithms.
